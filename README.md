Discipline is about focusing on the necessary and getting rid of the unnecessary things.

Enumeration is key
Pay attention to what you see, what you hear, what you think, what you do
Understand the dependencies and relationships
Take breaks at least for 20 minutes
Try smarter, try differently
Have fun
You can
